# What We Do

Our mission is to empower anyone to build websites using open source tools. We teach how to use the technology along with supporting open source projects and communities. We publish both paid and free tutorials, conduct workshops, organize, present at and sponsor events, contribute code and documentation, and work in a variety of open source community leadership roles.

As a company we also deliberately work to create a positive and sustainable business. We're focused on building an open and transparent company that values its employees and the impact we have on the world. Everyone on the team is involved in  decisions and tasks that define the future of the company.

We are most well known for our online Drupal training membership service, <a href="https://drupalize.me/">Drupalize.Me</a>.
