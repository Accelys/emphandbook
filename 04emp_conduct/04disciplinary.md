# Disciplinary Action
Disciplinary action at Lullabot Education is intended to fairly and impartially correct behavior and performance problems early on and to prevent re-occurrence.

Discipline is decided on a case-by-case basis. Generally on the first incident we will just have a conversation (depending on how severe). Be aware that disciplinary actions may involve any of the following: verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or without pay, and termination of employment, depending on the severity of the problem and the frequency of occurrence. Lullabot Education reserves the right to administer disciplinary action at its discretion and based upon the circumstances.

Lullabot Education recognizes that certain types of employee behavior are serious enough to justify termination of employment, without enacting other disciplinary action first.
