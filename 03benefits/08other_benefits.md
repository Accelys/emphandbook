# Other Benefits
These are a few other nice extras we provide for the team. If you think we should offer some other new benefit, please share that with the team for discussion.

## Flight upgrades
We can travel a lot, depending on roles and needs. Lullabot Education will cover a seat upgrade if it's needed to make your trip more comfortable, up to $75 for domestic travel and up to $150 for international travel. We trust that each person can decide when it is appropriate to upgrade, and we generally do not expect people to use upgrades for every flight.

## Activity tracker
Lullabot Education provides each employee with an activity tracker (FitBit, Garmin Vivo*, Misfit, etc.). We do a lot of sitting at Lullabot Education so we want to encourage everyone to get out and stretch your legs. To get your device of choice, contact the CEO.
