# Lullabot Education Handbook
This handbook will introduce you to Lullabot Education, and give you an overview of our benefits and policies. It also provides some orientation for what it will be like when you first start working here, and points to the most important tools and processes to focus on in your first few weeks. This handbook is not the sum total of all of the documentation you will end up reading. We have extensive operations documentation that gets into the details of how to do a huge range of tasks.

## Changes in Policy
Company change is inevitable. Therefore, we expressly reserve the right to interpret, modify, suspend, cancel, or dispute, all or any part of our policies, procedures, and benefits at any time, with or without prior notice. Changes will be effective on the dates determined by Lullabot Education. After those dates all superseded policies will be null and void.

No individual has the authority to alter the foregoing. Any employee who is unclear on any policy or procedure should consult with the CEO.
