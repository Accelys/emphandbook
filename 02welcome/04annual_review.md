# Annual Review
Around your first year anniversary and in subsequent years, you will meet with the CEO for an annual review. During the review, you have the opportunity to take a long look at your work in the company. While regular check-in calls can always be used for this purpose, we find that those weekly or monthly discussions tend to focus on shorter term objectives. Setting aside time for an annual look helps ensure that we keep your day-to-day work connected to your long-term goals.

The review covers 4 main questions, and then allows for deeper discussion on any other topics either you or the CEO would like to discuss. Our 4 base questions are:

- What do you think are your biggest accomplishments from the past year? Did you achieve your aspirations?
- What would you like to improve upon? How could the team and/or your manager help? 
- Over the last 12 months, have there been any disappointments or surprises?
- What aspirations do you have for the coming year?

If you feel that those questions aren't touching on the things you'd really like to discuss, you have the opportunity to figure out the main topics for the review with the CEO prior to the meeting.
